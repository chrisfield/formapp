# Example forms built using redux-formkit

The example form contains text, checkbox and radio inputs and a field-array with add/remove buttons. It has field and inter-field valiation and shows the current valid status. It's the one I made up while doing the initial dev work for [redux-formkit](https://github.com/chrisfield/redux-formkit). I intend to replace with purpose built examples.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and from the root directory:
* npm install
* npm start

It runs with with create-react-app.
