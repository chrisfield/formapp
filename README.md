# Example forms built using redux-formkit

The first/only example shows text, checkbox and radio inputs and a field-array with add/remove buttons. It has field and inter-field valiation and shows the current valid status. It's the one I made up while doing the initial dev work for redux-formkit and I "intend" to replace it with examples that make more sense.

## Getting Started

To wite this used create-react-app added redux, react-redux & redux-formkit and put the example code in src. Download this repo run npm install.
